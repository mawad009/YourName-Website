        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administrationüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a sophomore at the university of riverside. My major is business in economics. I did not always know what I was going to come into but this quarter, after many research and advising I knew that the business field is where I‚Äôd fall best into. I come from a family line of business majors which helped me pursue that choice. My family owns Royal Traditions- which is a family company that sells linens. This may vary from curtains, to bed sheets. Earlier this year we bought a warehouse that is located in riverside. Over the past summers, my father had me working there in order to get the hands on experience needed. I did not know what I would be doing there or if I would excel at it. After a while, I was put into different job tasks that later on I came to manage a few workers from the agency to help promote the product. I had never had any experience with being a leader at a work environment but that taught me the rights and wrongs of being a ‚Äúboss‚Äù even though my position was not that high. <br><br>

        I went to Bloomington high school located in San Bernardino. It is a small public school that was not the best know for its academic scholars, but I excelled throughout my four years there. I ended it with a 4.61 gpa and as third of my class. I liked to challenge myself so I attended all Ap and honor courses at my time there. I had many hardships there since it was so easy to just take the normal classes but instead I stuck with my need to do the best and aim to be recognized by the best schools. I was part of many clubs at the school such as National honors society, CSF, chess club, Ap Angels and many more. A friend and I started our own club there called Ap literature club in which those who are interested in reading and poems will get together and discuss known poets and artist from history. 
<br><br>

        I believe that my experience at work and school gave me many skills to become the scholar that I am today. I do see that there are many things that I can learn and fix about myself and I am open minded to working on myself to be the best that I can be for a successful life. I have many discussions with my dad about how he started his business and it inspires me on how someone with nothing can build an honest work and become a owner of a successful business. The business industry has many failures that might happen but I believe that with the right mindset; if you desire to become something or someone then that is possible as long as you are willing to accept failure. Overall, I have had a great deal of experiences that have helped me develop into an experienced, well rounded individual within and outside the professional world.
